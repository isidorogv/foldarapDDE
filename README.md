# What's that?

**Scalable Foldarap** is a modified version of Foldarap v.1.0 3D printer originally made by [EnmanuelG](https://github.com/EmmanuelG/Foldarap).

Modification is basically a parametric source file which different printer sizes can be built from. Check some examples [here](https://github.com/isidorogv/foldarap_escalable/wiki/Lista-de-Materiales). Openscad files are supplied in order to make your own custom adjustements.
